# Loan Approval Prediction and Fairness Evaluation

This project explores the use of Machine Learning (ML) models for loan approval predictions and extends it into a **Responsible AI case study**, focusing on bias detection and fairness mitigation across sensitive attributes (e.g., gender).

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Build a **standard ML classifier** to predict loan approval outcomes.
- Evaluate **fairness** across demographic groups using **Fairlearn**.
- Apply **bias mitigation** techniques to improve fairness while maintaining model accuracy.
- Integrate both **predictive performance** and **ethical AI practices**.

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

- **Phase 1**: Train and evaluate a standard ML classifier (Logistic Regression/Decision Tree).
- **Phase 2**: Measure fairness metrics using **Fairlearn**.
- **Phase 3**: Apply fairness mitigation (e.g., reweighing, threshold optimization).

## âœ… Phase 1: Loan Approval Prediction Summary

The best-performing model was **Gaussian Naive Bayes (78.86% accuracy)**, followed by Random Forest (76.4%), K-Nearest Neighbors (75.6%), and Decision Tree (73.9%).

### ðŸ“Š Key Highlights:

- **Best Model**: Gaussian Naive Bayes (78.86% accuracy)
- **F1-Score**: 85.87%
- **Observation**: High accuracy for approvals, lower performance on rejections, indicating potential fairness concerns.

### ðŸ“ˆ Conclusion:

The baseline prediction model performs well overall but shows bias towards loan approvals, motivating the need for fairness analysis in **Phase 2**.
